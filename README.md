## DO NOT CLONE CODE. USE [PREPACKAGED RELEASE](https://github.com/redrott/valheim-mod-sync/releases) INSTEAD AND UPDATE VIA MOD UPDATER IF NECCESARY.

ADD THE CONTENTS OF THIS ZIP FILE TO YOUR VALHEIM STEAM DIRECTORY

Such as [...]\Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim

After you unzipped everything accordingly, your folder should look something like this ::

```
\_ Valheim\
    \_ BepInEx\
    \_ doorstop_libs\
    \_ Mod_Updater\
    \_ MonoBleedingEdge\
    \_ valheim_Data\
    \_ doorstop_config.ini\
    \_ Mod_Update_Valheim.bat
    \_ steam_appid.txt\
    \_ UnityCrashHandler64.exe
    \_ UnityPlayer.dll
    \_ valheim.exe
    \_ winhttp.dll
```
![Example]([https://octodex.github.com/images/bannekat.png](https://files.catbox.moe/cmmrar.png)



Then run the " Mod_Update_Valheim.bat " script.

You will receive a list of all newly downloaded files and then it 
should read " #### FINISHED UPDATE #### "

Everytime you want to update all the mods ( or remove old ones ) just run the script!

:)
